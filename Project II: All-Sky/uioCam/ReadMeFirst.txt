This is archive of uioCam v.2.1 software updated in 2020
during internship at Andoya Space Center for All-Sky
system at Alomar Observatory.

To compile the program you will need Python 3.7 and
Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 and all additional
libraries and dependencies. The folder set-up was left
in this archive to make uioCam set-up easier for future
users and developers.

All instructions can be found in internship report from 2020.
